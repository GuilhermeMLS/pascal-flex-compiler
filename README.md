## Pascal Flex Compiler

[Work in progress]

A Simplified Pascal compiler that uses [Flex](https://github.com/westes/flex.git) and [Bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/) to compile code to MEPA (abbreviation for Pascal Execution Machine in Portuguese), which is a 
virtual machine to execute Simplified Pascal programs. Simplified Pascal is a subset of the Pascal programming language.
